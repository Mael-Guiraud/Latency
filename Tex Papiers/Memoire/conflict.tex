%Notice that the notion of $P$-periodic affectation \textbf{is not monotone} with regard to $P$. 
%Indeed, consider messages of size 1, we can build a ${\cal R}$-matching of a graph, with ${\cal L}$ routes $r_1, \dots, r_{{\cal L}-1}$ which all intersect two by two and such that if $r_i$ and $r_j$ have $v$ as first common vertex we have $\lambda(v,r_i) - \lambda(v,r_j)=1$.
%Therefore there is a $2$-periodic affectation by setting all $m_i$ to $0$.

A {\bf conflict graph} represents the collision between the routes of a routed network $N$. The vertices of a conflict graph $G = (V,E)$ are the routes of $N$, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if there is a common arc between the two routes in the matched graph.
 
 Given $u$ and $v$ two vertices of the conflict graph, corresponding to two routes colliding in the matched graph. The weight of an edge, $w(u,v)$, is the absolute value of the difference between the distance of the two routes between their respective source node and the collision point.
 
 A labeling $F$ of such a graph is an affectation of an integer to each vertex, such that for each vertex $u$, $f(u) \neq f(v)+w(u,v)\mod P$, where $v$ are the neighbors of $u$ in the conflict graph and $P$ our period.
