%Ordonnancement de messages périodiques et de leurs réponses sur un lien partagé

%Le Cloud-RAN est une nouvelle architecture de réseau mobile dans laquelle les unités de calcul, traditionnellement 
% installées au pieds des antennes, sont déportées dans des data-centers distants. Dans ces conditions, pour respecter des contraintes liées aux protocoles 4G et 5G, il faut minimiser la latence des messages périodiques envoyés par les antennes
%à leurs unités de calcul. Nous essayons donc ici de trouver des plans périodiques de transmission des messages qui ne nécessitent pas de buffer et donc de latence supplémentaire.

%Dans cet article nous étudions une topologie en étoile, ou la contention vient d'un lien partagé entre toutes les antennes.
%Pour des messages arbitrairement grand, nous montrons qu'il existe toujours un plan de transmission des messages si la charge du réseau est inférieure à $40\%. De plus, nous montrons comment réduire le problème à des messages de taille unitaire
%pour une latence additionnelle modeste.

%Pour les messages de taille $1$, nous donnons un algorithme en temps polynomial qui trouve un plan de transmission
%pour des charges jusqu'à $58\%$. De plus, en analysant un algorithme aléatoire glouton, pour n'importe quelle charge,

\begin{abstract}

Cloud-RAN is a recent architecture for mobile networks where the processing units are located in 
 in distant data-centers while, until now, they were attached to antennas. The main challenge, to fulfill protocol time constraints, is to guarantee a low latency for the periodic messages sent from each antenna to its processing unit and back. The problem we address is to find a sending scheme of these periodic messages without contention nor buffering.

We focus on a simple but common star shaped topology, where all contentions are on a single arc shared by all antennas. For messages of arbitrary size, we show that there is always a solution as soon as the load of the network is less than $40\%$. Moreover, we explain how we can restrict our study to message of size $1$ without increasing too much the global latency. 

For message of size $1$, we prove that it is always possible to schedule them, when the load is less than $58\%$ \todo{tu m'a dis 63 au telephone non ? -> ça change tout le temps, je mettrais la vrai valeur quand j'aurai fini la preuve} using a polynomial time algorithm. Moreover, using a simple random greedy algorithm, we show that almost all
instances of a given load admit a solution, explaining why most greedy algorithms work so well in practice.

Mélanger l'introduction et le modèle. Voir comment c'est présenté dans two flow shop

In this article, we model a very simple network in which periodic messages flow through a single link. The answer to each message is then sent back through the same bidirectional link. The model and problem can easily be generalized to any network, that is any directed acyclic graph with any number of contention points, see \cite{dominique2018deterministic}. We choose here to present the simplest non trivial such network, for which we can still obtain some theoritical results. 

The time is discretized and the process we consider is periodic of fixed integer period $P$. We use the notation $[P]$ for the set $\{0,\dots,P-1\}$. In our application, all messages are of the same nature, hence they are all of the same size denoted by $\tau$. This size corresponds to the time it requires to send it through some contention point of the network.
We denote by $n$ the number of messages, which are numeroted from $0$ to $n-1$. A message $i$ is caracterized by its delay $d_i$. It means that if the message number $i$ goes in the link at time $t$, then it returns to it in the other direction at a time $t + d_i$.

Since the process we describe is periodic, we chose any interval of $P$ unit of time.
Describing the messages going through the two contention points during such an interval
completely define the periodic process. We call the representation of the interval
of time in the first contention point the \emph{first period} and the \emph{second period}
for the second contention point.

An \emph{offset} of a message is a choice of time at which it arrives
at the first contention point. Let us consider a message $i$
of offset $o_i$, it uses the interval of time $[i]_1 = \{ (o_i + t) \mod P \mid 0 \leq t < \tau \}$ in the first period and $[i]_2 = \{ (d_i + o_i + t) \mod P \mid 0 \leq t < \tau \}$ in the second period. We say that two messages $i$ and $j$ collide if either $[i]_1 \cap [j]_1 \neq \emptyset $ or $[i]_2 \cap [j]_2 \neq \emptyset $.

We want to send all messages, so that they are no collision in the common link.
In other word, we look for a way to send the messages without using buffering and 
hence limiting the latency to the physical length of the link. An assignment is a
choice of an offset for each message such that \emph{no pair of message collide}.
Formally, an \emph{assignment} is a function from the messages, represented by their indices in $[n]$ to their offsets in $[P]$.  

We call Periodic Message Assignment or \pma the problem we study in this article,
which asks, given an instance of $n$ messages, a period $P$ and a size $\tau$ to find 
an assignment or to decide there is none.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{instance}
\end{center}
\caption{An instance oof \pma ($3$ messages, $P= 10$ and $\tau = 2$) and one of its assignments}
\end{figure}
The complexity of \pma is not known. However, we have proven that when parametrized by
$n$ the number of messages, the problem is \FPT~\cite{barth2018deterministic}.
A slight generalization of \pma, with several contention points but each message only goes through two as in \pma is \NP-hard~\cite{barth2018deterministic}. If the the link is not bidirectional, that is there is a single contention point and each message goes through it twice, it is also \NP-hard~\cite{}. Hence, we conjecture that \pma is \NP-hard.

To overcome the hardness, we study \pma in this article when the load of the system is small enough. The \emph{load} is defined as the number of unit of time used in a period by messages in a contention point divided by the period. Hence the load is equal to $n\tau /P$.
Our aim is to prove that for small load, there is \emph{always} an assignment and that it can be found by a polynomial time algorithm.


\section{Greedy Algorithms for Large Messages}

In this section, we study the case of large messages. When modelizing real problems,
it is relevant to have $\tau > 1$ when the transmission time of a single message is large with regard to its delay.


A partial assignment $A$ is a function defined from a subset $S$ of $[n]$ to $[P]$.
We say that $|S|$, the cardinal of the domain of $A$, is its \emph{size}.
We say that a message in $S$ is \emph{scheduled} (by $A$), and a message not in $S$ is \emph{unscheduled}. We only consider partial assignments such that no pair of messages of $S$ collide. If $A$ has domain $S$, and $i \notin S$, we define the extension of $A$ to the message $i$ by the offset $o$, denoted by $A[i \rightarrow o]$, the function defined as $A$ on $S$ and $A[i \rightarrow o](i) = o$.

All presented algorithms build the assignment incrementally, by growing the size of the domain of a partial assignment. Moreover, the algorithm of this section are greedy since once an offset is chosen for a message, it is never changed.


\subsection{First fit}


Assume that for some partial assignment $A$, the message $i$ has offset $o$: it uses all times from $o$ to $o + \tau -1$ in the first period. If a message $j$ is scheduled with some offset $o'$ before $o$, then the last time it uses in the first period is $o'+\tau-1$ and it should be less than $o$, which implies that $o' \leq o - \tau + 1$. If $o'$ is larger than $o$, to avoid collision between messages $j$ and $i$, it should be larger or equal to $o+ \tau$. Hence the message $i$ forbids $2\tau -1$ offsets for messages still not scheduled because of this use of time in the first period. The same reasonning can be done for the second period, wich again forbids $2\tau -1$ offsets. Hence, if $|S|$ messages are already scheduled, then $|S|(4\tau -2)$ offsets are forbidden for the an unscheduled messages. Note that this is an upper bound on the number of forbidden offsets, since the same offset can be forbidden because of a message on the first and also on the second period.


We define $Fo(A)$, the maximum number of forbidden offsets when 
extending $A$. Formally, assume $A$ is defined over $S$ and $i\notin S$, 
it is the maximum over all values of $d_i$ of $|\left\{ o \in [P] \mid A[i \rightarrow o] \text{ has no collision }\right\}|$. The previous paragraph shows that $Fo(A)$ is always bounded by $(4 \tau -2)|S|$. 

The first algorithm deals with the route in the order they are given:  for each unscheduled route it tests all offsets from $0$ to $P-1$ until one do not create a collision with the current assignment.
We call this algorithm \emph{First Fit}. Remark that if $Fo(A) < P$, then whatever the delay of the route we want to extend $A$ with, it is possible to find an offset. Since $Fo(A) \leq (4 \tau -2)|S|$ and $|S| < n$, First Fit (or any greedy algorithm) will always succed when $(4 \tau -2)n \leq P$, that is when the load $ n\tau /P$ is less than $1/4$.
It turns out that First Fit always create compact assignments (as defined in~\cite{barth2018deterministic}), that is a message is always next to another one in one of the two period. Hence, we can prove a better bound on $Fo(A)$, when $A$ is built by First Fit, which implies the following theorem.


\begin{theorem}
First Fit always solves \pma positively on instances of load less than $1/3$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
To prove the theorem, we prove that by induction on the size of $S$ that $Fo(A) \leq |S|(3\tau -1) + \tau -1$.  For $S = 1$, it is clear since a single message forbid at most $(3\tau -1) + \tau -1 = 4\tau-2$ offsets, as explained before. Now, assume $Fo(A) \leq |S|(3\tau -1) + \tau -1$ and consider a route $i \notin S$ such that First Fit builds $A[i \rightarrow o]$ from $A$. By definition of First Fit, choosing $o-1$ as offset creates a collision, w.l.o.g. 
say it is a collision in the first period. It means that there is a shceduled message between $o - \tau $ and $o-1$ (modulo $P$), hence all these offsets are forbidden by $A$.
The same offsets are also forbidden by the choice of $o$ as offset for $i$, then only $3\tau -1$ new offsets are forbidden, that is $Fo(A[i \rightarrow o]) \leq Fo(A) + (3\tau -1)$,
which proves the induction and the theorem.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Meta-intervals}

The second method is described  in~\cite{barth2018deterministic} and achieves the same bound on the load using a different method which is also be used in the more involved algorithms
of the next section.
The idea is to restrict the possible offsets at which messages can be scheduled. It seems counter-intuitive, since it decreases artificially the number of possible offsets to schedule new messages. However, it allows to reduce the number of forbidden offsets, when the algorithm is designed accordingly. A \emph{meta-offset} is an offset of value $i\tau$,
with $i$ an integer from $0$ to $P / \tau$. We call Meta-Offset the greedy algorithm
which works as First Fit, but consider only meta-offsets when scheduling new messages. 

We define $Fmo(A)$ as the maximal number of meta-offsets forbidden by $A$. 
 By definition, two messages with a different meta-offset cannot collide in the first period.
Hence, $Fmo(A)$ can be bounded by $3|S|$ and we obtain the following theorem.


\begin{theorem}[Proposition 3 of~\cite{barth2018deterministic}]
Meta-Offset always solves \pma positively on instances of load less than
$1/3$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Tuples and meta-intervals}

We now propose a more involved family of greedy algorithms which 
solves \pma positively for larger loads. We try to combine the good properties of the two previous algorithms: the compacity of the solutions of the first one and the use of meta-offsets of the second algorithm to reduce collisions on the first period.
The idea is to schedule several messages at once, using meta-offsets, to maximize the compacity of the obtained solution. 


We first describe the algorithm which places pairs of routes and then explain quickly how we can extend it by placing tuples of messages instead of pairs.

We first needs a lemma which allows to assume that the period $P$ is a multiple of $\tau$, 
which makes the analysis of our algorithms much simpler and tighter. It only changes the load
from $n \tau / P$ to at most $n (\tau +1)/ P$: the difference is less than $n /P < 1/\tau$,
and is very small for large $\tau$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $I$ be an instance of \pma with $n$ messages of size $\tau$ and period $P$.
Let $m = P / \tau$. There is an instance $I'$ with $n$ messages of size $\tau'$ and period $P'= m\tau'$ such that an assignment of $I'$ can be transformed into an assignment of $I$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $P = m \tau + r$ with $r \leq \tau$. We define the instance $I'$ as follows: $P' = mP$, $d_{i}' = m d_i$ and $\tau' = m \tau + r$. With this choice, we have $P' = m(m \tau + r) = m \tau'$.
Consider an assignment $A'$ of the instance $I'$.
If we let $\tau'' = m\tau$, then $A'$ is also an assignment for $I'' = (P',\tau'',(d_{0}',\dots,d_{n-1}'))$ since we only reduce the size of each message (the interval of time used in the first and second period begin at the same position but are shorter).
We then use a compactification procedure as in~\cite{barth2018deterministic}. The first message is positionned at offset zero. The first time it uses in the second period is a multiple of $m$ since its delay is by definition a multiple of $m$. Then all the other messages are translated to the left until there is a collision (remove increasing values from all offsets but the offset of the first message). It guarantees that some message is in contact with the first one,  which implies that its offset is a multiple of $m$. This procedure can be repeated until we get some solution $A''$ to $I''$, and by induction it is proven that all positions of messages in the first and second period are multiple of $m$. Hence, if we define $A$ as $A(i) = A''(i)/m$, we obtain an assignment of $I$.
\end{proof}

From now on, we always assume that $P = m\tau$ and the load is then $n/m$.
We are interested in the remainder modulo $\tau$ of the delays of each message.
We write $d_i = d_{i}'\tau + r_i$ and assume from now on that messages are sorted by increasing $r_i$.
A \emph{compact pair} is a pair of messages $(i,j)$ with $i < j$ such that we can put them
next to each other in the second period using meta-offsets.
We have $r_i \leq r_j$ since $i < j$. We denote by $g$ the gap between the two messages in the first period, that we define by $d_{i}' = g + 1 + d_{j}' \mod m$. We require that $g \neq 0$ so that there are no collision in the first period if we schedule these two messages such that the difference of their offsets is the gap. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{compact_pair}
\end{center}
\caption{Representation of a compact pair scheduled using meta-offsets}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:pair_find}
Given $3$ messages, two of them always form a compact pair. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If the first two messages or the first and the third message form a compact pair,
then we are done. If not, then by definition $d_{1}' = 1 + d_{2}' = 1 + d_{3}'$. Hence, the messages $2$ and $3$ have the same delay and form a compact pair of gap $1$.
\end{proof}

We call \emph{Compact Pairs} the following greedy algorithm. From the $n$ routes in order
of increasing $r_i$, we build a sequence of at least $n/3$ compact pairs using Lemma~\ref{lemma:pair_find}. They are then scheduled in the order they have been built using meta-offsets only. If at some point all compact pair are scheduled or the current one cannot be scheduled, the remaining messages are scheduled as in Meta-Offset. The analysis of the algorithm relies on the evaluation the number of forbidden meta-offsets. In the first phase
of the algorithm, one should evaluate the number of forbidden offsets when scheduling a compact pair, that we denote by $Fmo_2(A)$. In the second phase, we need to evaluate 
$Fmo(A)$. A compact pair only forbids three offsets in the second period instead of four if the two messages are scheduled independently, which explains the improvement from Meta Offset. We first give a simple lemma justified by Figure~\ref{fig:forbidenmeta}, which allows to bound this number.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:pair_forbid}
A compact pair already scheduled by Compact Pair forbid at most four meta offsets in the second period to another compact pair when it is scheduled by Compact Pair.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
Compact Pairs always solves \pma positively on instances of load less than
$3/8$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let us denote by $n_2$ the number of compact pairs scheduled in the algorithm.
If we want to schedule a new pair, the position of the $2n_2$ messages on the first
period forbid $4n_2$ offsets for a compact pair. Indeed, each scheduled message can collide
with each of the two messages which form a compact pair. On the second period, we can use Lemma~\ref{lemma:pair_forbid} to bound the number of forbiden offsets by $4n_2$. 
Hence, we have established that at the end of the first phase, the partial solution $A$
satisfies $Fmo_2(A) \leq 8n_2$. This first phase continue while there is possible offsets for compact pairs, which is the case when $Fmo_2(A) \leq m$, that is while $n_2 \leq m/8$.
In the second phase, a compact pair forbids $3$ meta offsets in the 
second period and $2$ in the first. Hence, if we let $n_1$ be the number of messages scheduled in the second phase to give the assignment $A$, we have $Fmo(A) \leq n_2*5 + n_1*3$. 
The algorithm can always schedule messages when $Fmo(A)$ is less than $m$, thus
$$ n_2*5 + n_1*3 \geq m$$
$$ n_1 \geq \frac{8m - 5m }{24}$$
$$n_1 \geq \frac{1}{8}$$

The number of routes scheduled is thus at least $2n_2 + n_1$,
which is $\frac{3}{8}m$. Remark that we need to be able to schedule two third of the messages as compact pairs, which is possible by Lemma~\ref{lemma:pair_find}. Therefore an assignment is always produced when the load is less then $\frac{3}{8}$.
\end{proof}

The algorithm can be improved by forming compact tuples instead of compact pairs.
A compact $k$-tuple is a sequence of messages $i_1 < \dots < i_k$ (with $r_{i_1},\dots,r_{i_k}$)  increasing, for which meta offsets can be chosen so that there is no collision and
the messages in the second period are in the order $i_1,\dots,i_k$, two consecutive messages $i,j$ have offset $o$ and $o + r_j -r_i + \tau$.

plus grand que la paire bleue déjà placée et donc 4 offsets interdits}

\end{center}
\label{fig:forbidenmeta}
\caption{Representation of the meta offsets forbiden by a compact $3$-uple in blue when scheduling a compact pair in red} 
\end{figure}


The algorithms \emph{Compact k-tuples} works by scheduling compact $k$-uples
using meta offsets while possible, then scheduling compact $k-1$-uples and so on until $k=1$.
The theorem we give is obtained for $k=10$, but taking arbitrary large $k$ and using more refined bounds on $Fmo(A)$ do not even yields a load better than $41/100$ and only works for larger $n$.


\begin{theorem}
Compact $10$-uples always solves \pma positively on instances of load less than $4/10$, for instances with $n$ large enough.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We use two facts, which generalizes Lemma~\ref{lemma:pair_find} and~\ref{lemma:pair_forbid} to prove this theorem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given $ k^3/3$ messages, one can build from them a compact $k$-tuple. 
The compact $k$-uple is built greedily using pigeon-hole principle or the fact that if there are $k$ messages with the same delay, they form a compact $k$-uple.
\item A $k$-tuples forbid $k+j+1$ offsets in the second period when scheduling a 
$j$-tuple. If the remainder of the messages in the $j$-tuples are larger than in the $k$-tuples, it forbids $k+j$ messages only.
\end{itemize}

The first fact garantees there are compact $k$-tuples, if there are enough messages,
hence $n$ should be larger than $k^3/3$.
The second one allows to estimate how many $i$-tuple for $i$ equal $k$ down to $1$ can be scheduled by bounding $Fmo_i(A)$, the number of forbiden meta-offsets when placing $i$-tuple in the algorithm.
If we denote by $n_i$ the number of compact $i$-tuples scheduled by the algorithm,
we have the following equation:  $$ Fmo_j(A) \leq \displaystyle{\sum_{j=i}^k n_j(j*i + j + i+ 1)}.$$
The equation for $n_1$ is slightly better: 
$$ Fmo(A) \leq \displaystyle{\sum_{j=1}^k n_j(2j + 1)}.$$
A bound on $n_i$ can be computed, since $A$ can be extended while $Fmo_j(A) < m$. A numerical computation of the $n_i$'s shows that the algorithm always find a solution when the load is less than $4/10$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Experimental results}

Results better in practice, the worst case is different from the 
average case.
The algorithms to test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item first fit
	\item choix randomisé de l'offset possible
	\item meta offset
	\item heuristic to build super compact assignment: among the compact assignments
possible, chose the one which minimizes the number of forbidden offsets
	\item algo avec les paires tant que c'est possible, si on a le temps
	\item FPT pour avoir la borne absolue
\end{itemize}

On représente le taux de succès en fonction de la charge. On peut faire
pour des paquets de taille $1000$ et une période de $100 000$ comme ça on
peut faire une charge par pas de 1 pour cent. On peut sans doute commencer
le graphique à 33 pour cent car la plupart des algos sont garantis marcher 
tout le temps en dessous. 
Meilleure idée ?

\section{Reduction from large message to message of size one}

In this section, we explain how we can restrict ourselves to the study 
of small $\tau$ and even $\tau = 1$ if we are willing to accept some 
buffering in our original problem or if we increase the load.


\subsection{Reduction without buffering}

We give a reduction from an instance of \pma to another one:
from $I = (P,\tau,(d_{0},\dots,d_{n-1}))$, we build $I' = P, 2\tau, (d_{0}-(d_{0}\mod 2\tau)+ \tau),\dots,d_{n-1} - (d_{n-1} \mod 2\tau) + \tau))$. The instance $I'$ has a load twice as large as $I$.
On the other hand, all its delays are multiples of $2\tau$ hence it is equivalent to the instance  $I'' = P/2\tau, 1,d_{0}/ 2\tau,\dots,d_{n-1} /2\tau))$. An assignment $A'$ of $I'$can be transformed into an assignment $A$ of $I$. Indeed, the message $i$ uses the offset $A'(i)$
to $A'(i) + 2\tau -1$ in the first period and $A'(i) + d_{i} - (d_{i} \mod 2\tau) + \tau$ to $A'(i) + 2\tau -1+ d_{i} - (d_{i} \mod 2\tau)  + \tau$.  The absolute value $\tau - (d_{i} \mod 2\tau)$ is less than $\tau$ by definition. If it is positive, then $A(i) = A'(i)$, if it is negative, then $A(i) = \tau + A'(i)$. By construction, a message scheduled by $A$ uses a strict subset of the times in the first and second period used by the same message scheduled by $A'$, which implies that $A$ is an assignment of $I$ if $A'$ is an assignment of $I'$. 

Ici un dessin pour expliquer la technique


\subsection{Reduction  using buffering}

We have presented our problem with a single degree of freedom by message: its
offset. We could also allow to buffer a message $i$ during a time $b$ between the two contention points, which means changing $d_i$ to $d_i + b$. The quality of the obtained solution is worst since the buffering add latency to the messages. We now describe how we can make a tradeoff between the added latency and the size of the messages, knwowing that smaller messages helps to schedule instances with higher load.


All messages are buffered enough time so that their $d_i$ have the same
remainder modulo $\tau$. It costs at most $\tau$ of buffering, which is not
so good for random instances (see~\cite{barth2018deterministic} for algorithms optimizing the latency), but much better than the theoritical upper bound of $P$ which allows to always find an assignment. We can choose the message with the longes route as reference remainder, hence that message needs zero buffering. However, the message with the second longest route may have a remainder of $\tau -1$, thus the worst case increase of total latency is $\tau -1$. When all delays are changed so that $d_i$ is a multiple of $\tau$, we have an
easy reduction to the case of $\tau = 1$, by dividing all values by $\tau$.

We can do the same kind of transformation by buffering all 
messages, so that $d_i$ is a multiple of $\tau / k$. The cost in term
of latency is then at most $\tau / k$ but the reduction yields messages of size $k$.
For small size of messages, it is easy to get better algorithm for \pma, in particular for $\tau =1$ as we show in the next section.
\begin{theorem}
Compact Pairs on instances with $\tau =2$ always solves \pma positively on instances of load less than $4/9$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We assume w.l.o.g that there are less message with even $d_i$ than odd $d_i$.
We schedule compact pairs of messages with even $d_i$, then we schedule single message with even $d_i$. The worst case is when there is the same number of the two types of messages.
The number of forbidden offsets for $n$ scheduled messages is bounded by 
$$ n/2 (1 + 3/2) + n/2(1 + 1).$$
Hence, we can always schedule messages when $n \leq (4/9)m$.
\end{proof}


If we do the previous reduction to the case $\tau=1$ while optimizing for the average added latency, we win a factor of two. The only degree of freedom in the reduction is the choice of the reference remainder (all other delays are modified to have the same remainder).
Define the average buffer time for a choice $t$ of reference by $B(t)$. 
If we sum $B(t)$ for $t=0$ to $\tau-1$, the contribution of each message 
will be $\sum_{i=0}^{\tau-1} i$. Since there are $n$ messages, the sum of the $B(t)$ for all $t$ is $n \tau (\tau-1)/2$. There is at least one term of the sum less than the average,
hence there is a $t_0$ such that $B(t_0) \leq n (\tau-1)/2$. In other word, the average
delay for a message, with this choice of reference is less than $\tau/2$.


\section{Going Above Load of 1/2 for messages of size one}

When $\tau = 1$, \emph{any greedy algorithm} finds a solution to \pma when the load is less than $1/2$ since $Fo(A) \leq (4\tau -2)|S| = 2|S|$ where $S$ is the number of scheduled messages. We now give a method which always finds a solution for load of $1/2 + \epsilon$.

To go above $1/2$ of load, we use an algorithm with three steps (which can be repeated to 
imrpve the algorithm). In the first step, any method is used to build the largest possible
partial assignment. Then, in a second step we allow to exchange scheduled messages with unscheduled ones to improve some global measure. In the last step, a subset of messages is selected because they have less conflicts with the already scheduled messages. This subset is then scheduled by any greedy algorithm. The algorithm is not greedy, since we allow to exchange a scheduled message with an unscheduled one and it requires to know all messages in advance. We could use a greedy second step or even a single pass greedy algorithm to go over $1/2$ of load using the same ideas. However, the proofs are more complicated and the $\epsilon$ for which they hold is much smaller.

\begin{definition}
The potential of a message of delay $d$, for a partial assignment $A$
is the number of integers $i \in [P]$ such that $i$ is used in the first period and $i+d \mod P$ is used in the second period.
\end{definition}

The potential of a message counts favorable configurations in terms of forbiden offsets.
Indeed, when $i$ is used in the first period and $i+d \mod P$ is used in the second period,
then the same offset is forbidden \emph{twice} for a message of delay $d$. Hence, the potential 
of a message is related to the number of possible offsets as stated in the following lemma. 

\begin{lemma}
Given a partial assignment $A$ of size $s$, and an unscheduled message of potential 
$p$, there are $p - 2l$ possible offsets which can be used to schedule it while extending $A$.
\end{lemma}

For our algorithm, we need a global measure of the quality of a partial assignment, 
that we try to increase in the first step of our algorithm. 
We call our measure \emph{the potential of an assignment} and we denote it by $Pot(A)$, it is the sum of potentials for $A$ of all messages in the instance.

Instead of decomposing this global potential as a sum over the messages, it can be understood
as a sum over positions as explained in the next definition and lemmas.
 
\begin{definition}
The potential of a position $i$, for a partial assignment $A$, is the number of messages of delay $d$ such that $i+d \mod P$ is used by a route scheduled by $A$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:pot_pos}
The sum of potentials of all positions used in the first period by messages scheduled by $A$ is equal to $Pot(A)$.  
\end{lemma}

By definition of the potential of the positions, we have the following simple invariant.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:inv}
The sum of potentials of all positions for a partial assignment with $k$ scheduled messages is $nk$.  
\end{lemma}

 As a consequence of this lemma, $Pot(A) \leq nk$ and in the algorithm we 
 propose, we guarantee to obtain at last half this value by using an exchange mechanism described in the next subsection.

\subsection{Swap and potential improvement}


Let $A$ be some partial solution of size $s$ and let $i$ be an unscheduled message of delay $d$. 
Assume that $i$ cannot be used to extend $A$. The swap operation is the following: 
select a free position $p$ in the first period, remove the message which uses the position $p+d$ in the second period from $A$ and add $i$ to $A$ with offset $p$. We denote this operation by $Swap(i,p,A)$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $A$ be some partial solution of size $k$ and let $i$ be an unscheduled message. If $i$ cannot be used to extend $A$, then either $Pot(A) \geq kn/2$ or there is a $p$ such that $Pot(Swap(i,p,A)) > Pot(A)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\label{lemma:swap}
The positions in the first period can be partitionned into two part: $P_{u}$ the positions used by some scheduled message and $P_{f}$ the positions unused.
Let us denote by $V_f$ the sum of the potential of the positions in $P_f$ and by $V_u$ the sum of the potentials of the positions of $P_u$. By Lemma~\ref{lemma:pot_pos}, since $P_f$ and $P_u$ partitions the positions, we have $V_f + V_u = kn$. Moreover, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:pot_pos}, $Pot(A) = V_u$, then $V_f + Pot(A) = kn$.

By hypothesis, since $i$ cannot be scheduled, for all $p \in P_{f}$, $p+d_i$ is used in the second period. We now define the function $F$ which associates to $p \in P_{f}$ the position $A(j)$ such that there is a scheduled route $j$ which uses $p+d$ in the second period, that is $A(j) + d_j = p + d \mod P$. The function $F$ is an injection from $P_{f}$ to $P_u$. Remark now that, if we compare $Swap(i,p,A)$ to $A$, on the second period the positions are used. Hence, the potential of each position stay the same after the swap. As a consequence, doing the operation $Swap(i,p,A)$ add to $Pot(A)$ the potential of the position $p$ and removes the potential of the position $F(p)$. 

Assume now, to prove our lemma, that for all $p$, $Pot(Swap(i,p,A)) \leq Pot(A)$. It implies that for all $p$, the potential of $p$ is smaller than the potential of $F(p)$. Hence,
since $F$ is an injection from $P_f$ to $P_u$, we have that $V_f \leq V_u = Pot(A)$.
Since $V_f + Pot(A) = kn$, we have that $Pot(A) \geq kn/2$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{The Swap Algorithm}


We now describe the algorithm, called Swap algorithm, to solve \pma with load $1/2 + \epsilon$. The first two step schedule messages so that the $Pot(A)$ is large enough. Then, it produces a set of messages $R$ in the following way: select the message of largest potential
not in $R$, add it to $R$ and remove it if necessary from the partial assignment. Then schedule or swap any unscheduled message until the potential is as large as before adding the previous message to $R$. When $R$ is of size $\epsilon P$ stops this process. Finally, using any greedy algorithm, the messages in $R$ are scheduled.

We now give an analysis of the algorithm, showing that it works for some value of $\epsilon$. 

\begin{theorem}
The two steps algorithm solves positively \pma for instances with $\tau =1$ and load $1/2 + 1/16$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 In the first step of the algorithm, we use any greedy algorithm which always schedules
 at least $k \geq P/2$ messages. In the second step, we obtain a partial assignment $A$ of size $k$ such that $Pot(A) \geq kn/2$ by Lemma~\ref{lemma:swap}. Hence, $Pot(A)$ is at least $Pn/4$.
 
Now in the next step, we select messages to add them to $R$. Since we select the message of highest potential,
it must be of potential higher than the average potential, that is $P/4$. Even when messages are removed from the partial 
assignment the value $Pot(A) > Pn/4$ is guaranteed by scheduling unscheduled messages and swaping exactly as in the first two steps. Remark that when a message is unscheduled  

At the end of the first step, we have a partial assignment $A$ and $Pot(A)$ is at least $Pn/4$. We select $R$ the set of $\epsilon P$ messages of largest potential. We assume they are of potential at least $2\epsilon P, 2\epsilon P +2,\dots ,4\epsilon P$ and show that the algorithm finds an assignment. Removing a message from $A$ remove at most $2$ to the 
potential of each other message. Hence, if we remove the routes in $R$ scheduled by $A$, the potential of the routes decreases by at most $2\epsilon P$. Hence, when scheduling the elements of $R$ in the second step, they are of potential at least $0, 2,\dots ,2\epsilon P$.
By definition of the potential of a message, the number of possible offsets for an unscheduled route when there are $l$ scheduled routes is equal to $m - 2l$ plus its potential. Hence, the number of possible offsets is always positive when scheduling the messages in the order of their potential and the algorithms builds an assignment.

Now, we determine $\epsilon$ such that the messages selected in $R$ are of potential at least $2\epsilon P, 2\epsilon P +2, \dots, 4\epsilon P$. Sort all messages by decreasing potential and assume that the previous condition is not met, that is the $i$th route in order of potential is of potential less than $4\epsilon P - 2i$. The potential of a single message is bounded by $P/2$ since each scheduled message contribute at most one to its potential. Therefore, the first
$i$ routes are of potential at most $P/2$ and the following ones of potential at most $4\epsilon P - 2i$. Therefore the potential is less than $iP/2 + (4\epsilon P - 2i) (n -i)$. This function is decreasing for $i \leq \epsilon P$, hence the potential should be less than $4\epsilon P n$.
 
 For the algorithm to succeed, we want the potential to be larger than $4\epsilon P n$ so that the condition on the routes of largest potential is met.
Hence we must satisfy the following equation:
 $$Pn/4 \geq 4\epsilon P n.$$
 $$ \epsilon \leq 1/16.$$
\end{proof}

By repeating the whole algorithm, while the obtained potential increases,
we can garantee a solution for larger load as stated in the next theorem.

\begin{theorem}
There is a polynomial time algorithm which solves positively \pma for instances with $\tau =1$ and load $2/3$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Écrire l'équation qui dit que réappliquer l'algo améliore le potentiel pour voir jusqu'ou
ça va -> 2/3

\end{proof}
Pour améliorer les résultats on peut répéter l'algo de swap une fois qu'on a obtenu 
au moins $(1/2 + \epsilon)P$ routes placées, pour obtenir $n^2/2$ en potentiel. 
On doit alors avoir $n^2/2 \geq 4\epsilon P n$, ce qui donne $\epsilon \leq 1/14$.
Si on veut pousser la technique plus loin, il faut améliorer la borne sur le potentiel.
Au lieu de prendre les $\epsilon P$ plus grandes routes, on prend pour $i$ de $1$
à $\epsilon P$ la route de plus petit potentiel supérieur à $2 \epsilon P$ et 
pour qu'elle existe, il suffit que le potentiel soit supérieur à $2\epsilon P (n -i)$.
À vérifier, si à un moment tout est de potentiel $2 \epsilon P$ au moins, alors 
c'est facile de conclure. On obtient alors $\epsilon \leq 1/6$, ce qui donne un algo
dès que la charge est inférieure à $2/3$.

Autre possibilité, améliorer le potentiel en obtenant plus que la moyenne, en jouant notemment sur la symétrie Backward et Forward.

\section{Algorithms for random instances}

\paragraph{$\tau = 1$}

We analyze the following process, called \textbf{Uniform Greedy} or UG.
For each element in order, chose one admissible position
uniformly at random. We analyze the probability that Uniform Greedy
solve the problem, averaged over all possible instances. 
It turns out that this probability, for a fixed load strictly less than one goes to zero when $m$ grows. 

Définir l'ensemble des solutions de taille $n$ parmi $m$.
\begin{theorem}
Given an instance of size $n$ uniformly at random UG
produces a solution uniformly at random or fail.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Regarder mes notes partielles pour compléter ça.
\end{proof}

Let us denote by $P(m,n)$ the probability that UG fails at the $n_th$
steps assuming it has not failed before.

\begin{theorem}
We have $$P(m,n) = \frac{\binom{n}{2n-m}}{\binom{m}{n}}.$$
In particular, $P(m,n) \leq f(\lambda)^m$, where $f(\lambda) < 1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Probability independent of the shift of the $n$ element, can say it is $0$.
It is the probability that two sets of size $n$ in $[m]$ are of union $[m]$.
It is the same as the probability that it contains a given set of size $m-n$.
Could find an asymptotic online.
\end{proof}

Can we make the same argument for a deterministic algorithm?
The not average version of the argument is the previous proof.

Show that we can find a solution for load $1/2 - \epsilon$, even for large 
$\tau$ if $n$ is large enough, using the trnasformation without buffering.
