	title = {5G {Fronthaul} – {Latency} and {Jitter} {Studies} of {CPRI} over {Ethernet}},
	abstract = {Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) is a successful industry cooperation defining the publicly-available specification for the key internal interface of radio base stations between the Radio Equipment Control (REC) and the Radio Equipment (RE) in the fronthaul of mobile networks. However, CPRI is expensive to deploy, consumes large bandwidth, and currently is statically configured. On the other hand, Ethernet-based mobile fronthaul will be cost-efficient and more-easily reconfigurable. Encapsulating CPRI over Ethernet (CoE) is an attractive solution, but stringent CPRI requirements such as delay and jitter are major challenges that need to be met to make CoE a reality. This study investigates whether CoE can meet delay and jitter requirements by performing FPGA-based Verilog experiments and simulations. Verilog experiment shows that CoE encapsulation with fixed Ethernet frame size requires about tens of microseconds. Numerical experiments show that the proposed scheduling policy of CoE flows on Ethernet can reduce jitter when redundant Ethernet capacity is provided. The reduction in jitter can be as large as one microsecond hence making Ethernet-based mobile fronthaul a credible technology.},

Unlike us, the authors treat only the go and not the return. On the other hand, they allow themselves several different flows of C-RAN, which our algorithms at the moment can not support.The proposed algorithm is a greedy routine that fixes the messages in the period in priority order on the routes. This routine is applied to all possible orders of routes and therefore gives an exponential algo.The results deal on the one hand with the choice of the split and its impact on the range that can be covered: trade off between a "heavy" split that has strong latency constraints but that allows not to waste time in the technical part (encapsulation), and a split "light" which has the opposite characteristics (long encapsulation but low latency constraints therefore greater distance).In the second part, the authors evaluate their algorithm and explain that they can do Zero jitter on lightly loaded networks.
To retain of this article: quotes at the beginning, data and interesting explanations on the CPRI.},

We study wormhole routing on network in which each physical channel, i.e., communication link, can support up to B virtual channels. We show that it is possible to route any set of messages with L flits each, whose paths have congestion C and dilation D in O((L+D)C(DlogD)1/B/B) flit steps, where a flit step is the time taken to transmit B flits, i.e., one flit per virtual channel, across a physical channel. We also prove a nearly matching lower bound; i.e., for any values of C, D, B, and L, where C, D⩾B+1 and L=(1+Ω(1))D, we show how to construct a network and a set of L-flit messages whose paths have congestion C and dilation D that require Ω(LCD1/B/B) flit steps to route. These upper and lower bounds imply that increasing the buffering capacity and the bandwidth of each physical channel by a factor of B can speed up a wormhole routing algorithm by a superlinear factor, i.e., a factor significantly larger than B. We also present a simple randomized wormhole routing algorithm for the butterfly network. The algorithm routes any q-relation on the inputs and outputs of an n-input butterfly in O(L(q+logn)log1/Bnloglog(qn)/B) flit steps. We present a nearly-matching lower bound that holds for a broad class of algorithms.},

	abstract = {A recent research effort has been devoted to cyclic scheduling problems that arise in the design of compilers for parallel architectures as well as in manufacturing systems. This paper is focused on the extensions of the basic cyclic scheduling problem (BCS), that seems to be one of the most suitable model for parallel processing applications. The properties of the earliest schedule of BCS are recalled and their most recent extensions are presented. Several generalizations of BCS that include resource constraints are then discussed. In particular, structural results and algorithms for periodic versions of job-shop and m-machines problems are reported.  4.1 Introduction  Up to now, cyclic scheduling problems have been studied from several points of view depending on the target application. A few theoretical studies have been recently devoted to these problems, in which basic results are often proved independently using different formalisms. We hope that this paper, without pretending to...},

This proves the existence of a well linked core in the Internet. On the other hand, the hyperbolicity (as a graph parameter) appears to be very low, reﬂecting a tree-like structure with respect to distances.

	abstract = {Clock synchronization procedures are mandatory in most physical experiments where event fragments are readout by spatially dislocated sensors and must be glued together to reconstruct key parameters (e.g. energy, interaction vertex etc.) of the process under investigation. These distributed data readout topologies rely on an accurate time information available at the frontend, where raw data are acquired and tagged with a precise timestamp prior to data buffering and central data collecting. This makes the network complexity and latency, between frontend and backend electronics, negligible within upper bounds imposed by the frontend data buffer capability. The proposed research work describes an FPGA implementation of IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) that exploits the CERN Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) system as a multicast messaging physical and data link layer. The hardware implementation extends the clock synchronization to the nanoseconds range, overcoming the typical accuracy limitations inferred by computers Ethernet based Local Area Network (LAN). Establishing a reliable communication between master and timing receiver nodes is essential in a message-based synchronization system. In the backend electronics, the serial data streams synchronization with the global clock domain is guaranteed by an hardware-based finite state machine that scans the bit period using a variable delay chain and finds the optimal sampling point. The validity of the proposed timing system has been proved in point-to-point data links as well as in star topology configurations over standard CAT-5e cables. The results achieved together with weaknesses and possible improvements are hereby detailed.},

To satisfy this need, industry-specific, often proprietary, solutions have been developed in recent decades. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is addressing a grand unification of these existing technologies to leverage cross-industry cost efficiency as well as to guarantee a stable growth path of communication capabilities. While the functionality of time-sensitive networking is exhaustively standardized in IEEE 802.1, configuration standards for TSN are largely missing. Thus, in this article we review the IEEE TSN standards, in particular 802.1Qbv, and continue to illustrate a reference model for traffic planning for time-sensitive communication. Furthermore, the article references a detailed technical report describing the complete model, which is ideally suited as a starting point for standardization and ensures the interoperability of future TSN traffic planning tools.},

However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with an Ethernet-based backbone, unifying several automotive domains in a single infrastructure. Today, there is remarkable interest in the IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocol suite, that provides end-to-end performance guarantees in Ethernet networks. But for the strict timing requirements of automotive control-traffic, these guarantees are too weak. An extension of Ethernet AVB with synchronous time-triggered traffic can overcome these limitations. In this paper, we investigate the coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous traffic by experimentally adding time-triggered messages to the credit-based shaper of AVB in a straightforward way. Based on simulations and analytical evaluations, we quantify the impact of such integration concepts for a reasonable design range. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a shaping strategy with concurrent AVB and time-triggered message, but show a significant impact of the schedule design on the asynchronous AVB streams. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for configurations that can improve end-to-end network performance for in-car applications by over 100\%.},

This article provides an up-to-date comprehensive survey of the IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet standards and the related research studies. The survey of these standards and research studies is organized according to the main categories of flow concept, flow synchronization, flow management, flow control, and flow integrity. ULL networking mechanisms play a critical role in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network access chain from wireless devices via access, backhaul, and core networks. We survey the studies that specifically target the support of ULL in 5G networks, with the main categories of fronthaul, backhaul, and network management. Throughout, we identify the pitfalls and limitations of the existing standards and research studies. This survey can thus serve as a basis for the development of standards enhancements and future ULL research studies that address the identified pitfalls and limitations.},

	abstract = {Peak rate of any given connection has been recognized as a basic traffic parameter for resource management in ATM broadband networks. Since the network cannot rely on user’s compliance when declaring his traffic parameters, the policing function has been introduced to monitor the traffic characteristics of any connection. So far, policing mechanisms proposed (Leaky Bucket, Jumping Window, etc.) in the literature are actually pick-up mechanisms since cells can pass transparently through unless a policing action (tagging or discarding) is performed according to some counting process. In the present paper, we analyse the impact of cell multiplexingjitter on policing mechanism dimensioning. Recognizing that dimensioning is a critical point for such mechanisms, we show that they cannot avoid network buffer overflow in certain conditions. Therefore, we introduce a new policing scheme, namely Cell Spacing, and two spacing algorithms are presented.},

	abstract = {Modeling the properties of the Internet topology aims at generating large scale artiﬁcial IP networks that mimic properties of real ones for simulation purposes. Current models typically consider the Internet as a simple graph where edges are point-to-point connections between routers. This approach does not take into account point-to-multipoint connections that exist at lower layers in the network, e.g. layer-2 clouds, such as Ethernet switches or MPLS networks. Instead, such physical point-to-multipoint connections are modeled as several logical IP level point-to-point connections.},

ABSTRACT="A recent trend in mobile networks is to centralize in distant data-centers
the processing units which were attached to antennas until now. The main
challenge is to guarantee that the latency of the periodic messages sent
from the antennas to their processing units and back, fulfills protocol
time constraints. We show that traditional statistical multiplexing does
not allow such a low latency, due to collisions and buffering at nodes.
Hence, we propose in this article to use a deterministic scheme for sending
periodic messages without collisions in the network thus saving the latency
incurred by buffering.

We give several algorithms to compute such schemes for a common topology
where one link is shared by all antennas. We show that there is always a
solution when the routes are short or the load is small. When the
parameters are unconstrained, and some buffering is allowed in the
processing units, we propose an algorithm (PMLS) adapted from a classical
scheduling method. The experimental results show that even under full load,
most of the time PMLS finds a deterministic sending scheme with no latency."
