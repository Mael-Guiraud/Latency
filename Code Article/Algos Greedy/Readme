The two folders correspond to the experiment of the sections III and V of the paper "Scheduling periodic messages on a shared link".

The folder "Large Messages" contains the source code of the experiment of the section III, and the folder "Messages of size 1" contains the source code of the experiment of section V.

You need to have installed gcc and gnuplot on your OS.
To launch an experiment, you can edit the parameters at the top of the C files, and launch the experiment with a simple "make". A pdf file with the performance of the algorithms will be generated in the folder.
