\chapter{Proof of Feasibility}
\label{chap:TSN}
\minitoc

The additional latency induced by contention buffers is one of the major manageable source of delay in an switched packets network.
In this thesis, we propose algorithms that minimize contention in several topologies, either by removing the contention buffers or computing traffic organization to minimize buffering time. The objective is to delay datagrams as little as possible in the network.
% Delay causes are various, but the buffering time due to contention that we try to minimize, is one of the major one. 

Our approach of the network consists in deterministically managing datagrams in each node in order to prevent contention. When it is not possible to get rid of the contention buffers, we want to fix the duration each datagram is bufferd. The contention buffers are not anymore a consequence of the traffic but a tool to manage it. This approach may look similar to the concept of Deterministic Networking. A working group from IETF called DetNet~\cite{finn-detnet-architecture-08} works in collaboration with TSN (Time Sensitive Networking)~\cite{ieee802}, a task group of IEEE, to develop technical solutions for deterministic networking. The main difference between DetNet and TSN is the layer it focus on. While DetNet works on Layer 3, TSN develops solutions for Layer 2. Whatever the case, using the term "deterministic" is inappropriate since all works related to DetNet or TSN are still based on statistical models. The latency gurantee given by those approaches are an upper bound on the latency, while we aim to minimize it.

In Section~\ref{sec:TSNqbv}, we introduce the IEEE standards for TSN that allows for a better network management based on  controlled management of flows in the switches. While TSN standards are designed to drive stochastic flows in network, we show that going further and managing deterministic traffic enable us to remove some technical constraint, and leads us to a new technology, that we call Hyper-TSN. Section~\ref{sec:platform} presents a prototype of a switch that goes beyond TSN, by delivering datagrams at exact planned dates. With Hyper-TSN, the additional latency due to contention buffers is minimized, even at full loads. Furthermore, we get rid of the synchronization constraint, with an innovative alignment mechanism. With Hyper-TSN, the latency is at physical limits.

\section{Customized Management of the Network}
\label{sec:TSNqbv}


The model we present in Chapter~\ref{chap:model} is based on several assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The algorithms we develop are based on a central knowledge of the network and suppose all nodes are able to follow instructions. There must be an entity that centralizes and manages the configuration of the nodes.
\item We assume the nodes are able to distinguish and manage different flows.
\item Because all nodes follows a global scheduling , we assume they are able to dynamically rectify the shift between the clocks.
\end{itemize}

We explain in this chapter how the recent standards developed by TSN task group is close from such a model, and we show the limits of TSN for deterministic networking that leads us to Hyper-TSN. A detailed survey of all TSN standards can be found in~\cite{8458130}. 


\subsection{Overview of TSN Standards}


\paragraph{Centralized vision of the network}
The standard IEEE 802.1Qat SRP~\cite{article} (Stream Reservation Protocol) provides a central management framework that allows a centralized entity to collect data about the flows. It has been improved by IEEE 802.1Qcc~\cite{6755436}. In these standards, a centralized entity called the \textbf{controller}, collect all required informations needed by users about the network (the routing, the periodicity and the size of the datagrams). This controller proposes a user interface that enable any user to collect all network informations in order to compute the configuration of the network. Figure~\ref{fig:networkcontroller} shows a network managed by a controller, communicating via its user interface with algorithms, and able to send requirement to the nodes. Such an approach is related to Software Defined Network (SDN)~\cite{li2015software}. We can find in~\cite{7356556} an example of an SDN for TSN.

\paragraph{Individual management of flows}

Standard 802.1Qbv~\cite{8613095} allows us to manage different flows in the nodes by a gate mechanism. Every output port of the switch is organized as follow. The flows are stored in traffic queues, and for each traffic queue, a gate is ordered to be open or closed. To do so, the switch needs a Gate Control List (GCL). This GCL is computed by the user, and sent to each switch of the network by the controller. It is a list of dates, and for every date of the list are specified the output ports (gates) of the switch which are open or closed.


Figure~\ref{fig:tsnqbv} from~\cite{durr2016no} shows the mechanism of a switch using 802.1Qbv technology. Considering a given period ($T_{cycle}$ in the figure), the switch selects at each time ($T_1 , T_2 , \ldots$ the queues that must be open to transmit datagrams. In figure~\ref{fig:tsnqbv}, at time $T_1$, all gates except the one for scheduled traffic are open, at time $T_2$, all gates are closed and at time $T_3$ only the gate for scheduled traffic is open.

  \begin{figure}
  \begin{center}

  \end{center}
  \caption{IEEE 802.1Qbv mechanism~(\cite{durr2016no})}\label{fig:tsnqbv}
  \end{figure}
      
With such a mechanism, it is possible to organize the flows in order to control the latency. The GCLs are computed upstream considering the traffic (size of the datagrams, periodicity, or average throughput of each flow for non deterministic traffic). Several works on Time Aware Shaping have been developed on this topic: \cite{al2017modeling} introduce how to manage one scheduled flow and one best effort flow (non periodic generation of data, stochastic model). This paper shows that by correctly setting the GCL of the nodes, it is possible to ensure no contention for one scheduled flow. Nevertheless, works about managing several scheduled flows together are mainly based on linear programing~\cite{steiner2018traffic,silviu2017,nayak2017incremental,naresh2016}, which has an high complexity and does not scale well with number of routes and contention depth of the networks.

\paragraph{Synchronization}
To be efficient, the components of the network must be completely synchronized. Such an hypothesis seems unrealistic. Standards likes IEEE 802.1AS~\cite{5741898}, or IEEE 1588~\cite{4579760} propose good solutions for clock synchronization, but this problem is still difficult to solve. Indeed, even if those protocols propose good solution to re-synchronize clocks, there may be some shift between clocks of different switches of the network. The major source of shift is the need to precisely evaluate the length of a link between two components. This value can be deduced from the travel time of datagrams between two switches but this value highly depends the temperature of the link which is not constant. Network designers use {\em Guard Time} to prevent this problem. The GCL are computed such that a gate is open before and after the theoretical arrival of datagrams. Such a mechanism induce an artificial use of bandwidth, because a gate is open even when no datagram is being transmitted.

\subsection{Limits of TSN when managing Deterministic flows}

All the previously mentionned standards are designed for a statistical management of the flows. In this thesis, we work on deterministic flows: our models and algorithms do not relies to a statistical approach like current traffic shaping, but a deterministic approach. We compute the exact date at which each datagram is able to reach each node, without loss of bandwidth due to guard time. Furthermore, a statistical approach does not allow to control the contention and the exact forwarding time of the datagram in the network. This implies that a datagram sent periodically does not always has the same latency over time. The variation of the latency is called \textbf{jitter}. The jitter is an indicator of the stability of the network. The higher the jitter, the higher the maximal value of the latency is.

A deterministic approach requires to rethink the network management. We control the position of a datagram at every moment in order to let them pass through the nodes without contention thanks to a gate mechanism similar to TSN Qbv. We thus need the nodes to be perfectly synchronized otherwise it could be counter productive. Indeed, if a datagram of a flow arrives in a node before the planned date, the gate is closed and the datagram is buffered, that induces additional latency due to contention buffer. In the worst case in which a datagram arrives after the planned date, it is buffered until the gate get open. In our context of periodic flows, the datagram will be buffered between up to one period.

Also, switches in the physical layer of the network induce an additional latency due to physical buffering. In store-and-forward concept~\cite{tindell1992store}, datagrams are stored at reception of a node before being forwarded. However, solution like cut-through~\cite{kermani1979virtual} allows to reduce storage size and corresponding delay to the header size only. But this is effective if the egress port is available to forward the datagram at the same time only. If not, the datagram is buffered until the port is free. Even if it is possible to adapt our model to take into consideration the physical buffering cost, it still induce additional latency, which is not desirable.

Next section present a new kind of switch, called Hyper-TSN switch, that allows to overcome all the above limits.

\section{Deterministic management for a deterministic latency}
\label{sec:platform}


Deterministic Networking are mentionned in the same survey cited ahead for TSN~\cite{8458130}. The researches about DetNet are untill now limited either to linear programming for finding scheduling policies for the network -as mentionned above- or traffic shaping (see~\cite{7092358} for a comparison of actual traffic shaping methods). Traffic shaping methods are based on stochastic models, with bounds on the arrival of the flows, that allows to bound the maximal latency. Nevertheless, as we mentionned ahead, Deterministic Networking do not propose a deterministic management of deterministic flows in order to ensure a minimal latency and $0$ jitter.

In this thesis we remove the contention buffer, or, if this is not possible, we use the contention buffers as a tool, by controling the buffering time of each datagrams while minimizing it. Furthermore, we remove jitters in network, which is a deeper aspect of deterministic networking.
Here, because of our desire to manage deterministic flows, multiple standards of TSN are not useful yet. Indeed, since the exact date of arrival of all datagrams are computed, we can get rid of several tools designed to manage the traffic on a statistical manner. 

We present in this section an Hyper-TSN switch that solves all the problematic of TSN when managing deterministic traffic.
This technology is under an advanced phase of research, and a prototype has been experimented in Nokia Bell Labs~\cite{guiraudleclercmarce2021}.

\subsection{Hyper-TSN switch}


A 2x2 Hyper-TSN switch has been developed. It is composed of a switching matrix connected to a deterministic scheduler and two 10 Gbps ethernet two ways transceivers. The switching matrix includes also a monitoring circuitry. The deterministic scheduler controls the switching matrix and is configured with a timing table. This table is similar to a 802.1 Qbv Gate Control List (GCL). It defines the periodicity of the scheduling and, for each egress ports, the planed date of arrival of the frames which are part of deterministic flows. At each of these dates the deterministic scheduler sets the switching matrix to transmit data incoming on a specified ingress port. Figure~\ref{fig:schedulehtsn} shows an example of scheduling both deterministic (but not periodic) and stochastic traffic.
 In such a switch, the buffers are totally absent for managed traffic: when a datagram arrives in the switch, it is instantly transmitted to the egress port, and there is no buffering operation. This process allows us to reduce the physical delay to its lowest for scheduled traffic, while it is still possible to buffer the Best Effort traffic, which has not critical latency constraints.

\caption{ The scheduling of a 2x2 switch on which both deterministic and stochastic traffics arrives. The deterministic traffic is forwarded without contention.}
\label{fig:schedulehtsn}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

To coordonate switches, Hyper-TSN considers the flow as a reference~\cite{leclerc2020optical} as we now explain. Since the exact arrival time of a datagram is known, if one datagram arrives before or after this expected date, this means the physical transmission delay between the sender of the datagram and the switch known by the controller is false. The monitoring circuitry of the switch detects this issue and an alert signal is sent to the controller that is able to reschedule correctly the GCL.
This ensure a dynamical clock alignment between the nodes, and it is possible because the switches are developed on components with industrial clocks (Xilinx FPGA boards : Zynq UltraScale MPSoC zcu102, Zynq-7000 SoC zc706). 
The switch also includes a frame analyzer that enables to check that the switched frames are not corrupted and none is missing.

\subsection{Implementation and reliability tests}

To perform experiments, a generator of deterministic flows has been developed. This generator set the dates it sends the frames according to the controls received from the monitoring circuitry. The period are defined in the timing table. The size of the frames is set to fully load the ethernet links (i.e. $100\%$ load).
When starting, the monitoring circuitry detects that frames do not arrive at the planed date and sends control commands to the generator. These first frames are lost. Then, the generator corrects the dates it sends the frames, and no more shifting has been observed during the running of a 2 hours experiment. $100\%$ of the frames are correctly switched without being corrupted or lost. The switching of each frame from the ingress port to the planed egress port is performed introducing only one clock cycle delay (here 3,87 ns).
Figure~\ref{fig:hypertsnswitch} shows the Hyper-TSN 2x2 switch used for our experiments.
